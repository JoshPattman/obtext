    @h1{ The Advantages of Objective Text }
    @h2{ Simplicity at its Core }
    @p{

    @h2{ A Robust Parser }
    @p{ 
        While it's true that the parser was developed during late-night coding sessions and is my first since a university project two years ago, it's designed to handle nested objects like @bold{this}.
