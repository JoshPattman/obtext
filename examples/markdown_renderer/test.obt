    @h1{ The Advantages of Objective Text }
    @h2{ Simplicity at its Core }
    @p{ 
        Objective Text stands out for its simplicity. Its grammar comprises just three elements: objects, arguments, and text. This paragraph will have the leading and trailing whitespace removed, so we can put it on a new line for readability.

    @h2{ A Robust Parser }
    @p{ 
        While it's true that the parser was developed during late-night coding sessions and is my first since a university project two years ago, it's designed to handle nested objects like @bold{this}. That is an inline nested object so the whitespace around it is not removed.

	@p{
		We can also use special symbols like \@, \{, and \} if we escape them: josh.pattman\@gmail.com
	}
