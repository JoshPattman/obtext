# A simple obt-to-markdown converter
> This only supports a small subset of markdown, and is meant to serve as a simple example rather than a tool.

## Running
Use `$ go run . -i <input-file-name.obt>`: This will convert the contents of the input file to a markdown file, `<input-file-name.md>`.

You can specify `-p` to also pretty-print the input file to stdout.
