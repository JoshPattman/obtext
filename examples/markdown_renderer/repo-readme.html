<h1>Objective Text - A Dead Simple Markup Language</h1>

	<p>Objective Text is a minimalist markup language designed for blog writing, designed by blending <code>html</code> and <code>latex</code>. Its key feature is its simplicity, with a grammar that consists of only three elements:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Objects: Denoted by <code>@object_name</code></li>
		<li>Arguments: Enclosed in <code>{argument text and objects}</code></li>
		<li>Text: Can be any string of characters</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Here's an example of how you might use Objective Text to structure a blog page:</p>

<pre><code>@doc {
    @h1 { Section 1: Why ObText Is The Best}
    @p {
        ObText is the best because it is the @b{best}.
    }
    @img {A picture of ObText being the best} {path/to/img.png}
}</code></pre>

	<p>For a more detailed example, take a look at <code>examples/markdown_renderer</code> example. It shows how you can convert from objective text to markdown, and was actually used to generate this README!</p>

	<h2>Understanding Objects</h2>

		<p>Objects are the fundamental building blocks of Objective Text. They're identified by an @ symbol followed by the object name (e.g. @header). Each object is followed by one or more argument blocks, enclosed in {}. Whitespace around these blocks is flexible for readability, and leading and trailing whitespace within argument blocks is automatically removed.</p>

		<p>One of the unique features of Objective Text is its flexibility. During the syntax parsing step, the parser will accept any object with any <code>@<object type></code>, and any number of arguments. However, during the step of converting they syntax tree to a semantic tree, the parser will check if each object is valid given the rules that you give it. Obtext comes with a set of default semantic rules for mark up purposes, <code>markup.Semantics</code>, but you can easily either modify them, or create your own from scratch. This means that it is trivial to create custom objects, such as an image gallery or a table of contents.</p>

	<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/JoshPattman/obtext"
	"github.com/JoshPattman/obtext/markup"
)

func main() {
	// First, open the file
	// We will read from an io.Reader in this example, but you can also read from a string or []byte
	f, err := os.Open("path/to/file.obt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	// Parse the syntax tree
	syntaxTree, err := obtext.ParseSynReader(f)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	// Parse the semantics tree according to the rules set in markup.Semantics
	semanticsTree, err := obtext.ParseSem(syntaxTree, markup.Semantics)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	// Do something with the semantics tree
	walk(semanticsTree)
}

func walk(node obtext.SemNode) {
	// ...
}
</code></pre>
